## I'm Jack, Web Dev ðŸ‘€

A recent grad from Dev Academy Aotearoa. I have experience with React.js, TypeScript, SQLite (Knex), auth0, CSS and HTML.
With a background working as a chef in restauraunts around Auckland, Waiheke Island and Brisbane, I bring a strong sense of communication and collaboration to any team project.
Currently looking for my first opportunity in the technology industry to start my new career.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on wrapping up our final project [pawpals](https://pawpals-matai-24.devacademy.nz/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Harvard's CS50x course online - furthering my understanding of lower level languages. Also planning to complete understanding node.js and learn as many languages and technologies I can.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects that I can learn from - whether that's from the people involved or the technologies involved!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my favourite foods, restauraunts, PC builds, the Carboniferous Era or my dog, Obi.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I own 2 ducks, they live near a vineyard and help with pest control in harvest season ðŸ¦†
